# Movie Scraper

I created this program as a way to check for movie availability on the top four streaming services
(HBO, Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu) with ease. It was made using Selenium to extract movie
data from the services' dynamic webpages. 

A user can just type in the title of the movie they are searching for, and the program will 
immediately output which of the streaming services the film is on. Based on matching keywords
with other available movie titles, the program will also provide lists of similar movies that
are available on the streaming services.

On the other hand, if the movie in unavailable on all four of the sites, the program scrapes
the internet for other streaming services that may have it. The program will also specify if 
the movie is free with subscription on the other service, or if you must pay and how much. 
Similar movies that are available for free on the top four streaming services are also provided.
